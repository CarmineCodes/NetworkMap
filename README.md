# NetworkMap
In my networking class, we worked with Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate our labs before we built them on physical hardware. I decided to take it to recreate my network with hardware available in the program. Some end user devices arent listed as i only included ones that the network either relies on, or is a workstation.![NetworkMap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63487881/148484992-28545464-b7a2-4b69-bfc0-da2275aed5b2.PNG)

Since cisco doesnt have nodes for firesticks i chose to omit them, i also used desktops to represent raspberry pis that work on my network.
